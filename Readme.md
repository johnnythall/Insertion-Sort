# Lab 1 - Insertion Sort
## Layout
Inside the repo for this lab you will find 3 folders. The `code` folder contains the actual code that should be run. The `data` folder contains the input and output txt files used and generated by the lab. The `spec` is there for use with rspec, which I started to use, but then unfortunately was not able to continue to use.

## How to run the lab
To run the lab follow these easy steps!

1. Make sure ruby is installed.
2. Navigate to the `data` folder.
3. Optionally change the input file.
4. Navigate to the `code` folder using your terminal or equivalent.
5. Run the code using "ruby insertion_sort.rb"
6. Return to the `data` folder and open ouput.txt to see the results.
7. The End.
